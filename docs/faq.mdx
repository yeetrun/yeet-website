## Is this intended for general use?

No. This is a personal homelab toolchain. The defaults and workflow are tuned
for a specific environment.

## Does yeet require Tailscale?

Yes. Yeet communicates with catch over Tailscale RPC.

## Do services run as root?

Yes. This is acceptable for this lab but not recommended for shared
environments.

## Can I use docker compose?

Yes. Provide a compose file to `yeet run`.

## How do I update a service?

Re-run `yeet run` with the updated payload. For compose services, `yeet run`
does not pull images by default; use `yeet run --pull <svc> ./compose.yml` or
`yeet docker update` (pulls images and recreates containers) when you want
fresh images.
