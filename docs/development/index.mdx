This page is for local dev on the yeet repo.

## Toolchain (recommended: mise)

If you already have Go in your `PATH`, you can skip mise and use the Go commands
below. Otherwise:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Swap `zsh` for your shell (bash/fish/etc.) if needed.

From the repo root, install tools (Go 1.25.5):

```bash
mise install
mise run install-githooks
```

The hook install uses `pre-commit` and sets up both the `pre-commit` and
`prepare-commit-msg` hook types. It also clears any existing `core.hooksPath` so
pre-commit can manage the hooks.

## Build

```bash
go build ./cmd/yeet
go build ./cmd/catch
```

## Test

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Run locally

Run catch in the foreground with a local data dir:

```bash
go run ./cmd/catch --data-dir ./data
```

Run yeet against a target host:

```bash
CATCH_HOST=<host> go run ./cmd/yeet status
```

## Notes

- Most CLI behavior is in `cmd/yeet` and `pkg/cli`.
- RPC handling lives in `pkg/catch` and `pkg/catchrpc`.
