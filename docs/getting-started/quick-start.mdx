description: Fastest path to a working yeet + catch install.
---

This is the TL;DR path to a working install. It assumes you have a Linux host
with systemd and SSH access. You do not need Tailscale installed on either
machine; yeet uses an embedded tsnet client for RPC. See
[Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for details.

## 1) Install yeet locally

Release install (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yeetrun.com/install.sh | sh
```

Nightly build:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yeetrun.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --nightly
```

## 2) Bootstrap catch on a host

Use SSH to install the catch service on a remote host:

```bash
yeet init root@<host>
```

If you use a non-root user, yeet will invoke sudo on the remote. Add `--nightly`
for nightly.

Note: this `<host>` is the **machine host** you SSH into. After install,
`yeet run <svc>@<host>` uses the **catch host** (Tailscale/tsnet hostname). See
[Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale).

## 3) Sanity check

```bash
yeet version
yeet status
```

## 4) Deploy something

Docker Compose (most common):

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./compose.yml --net=lan
```

Find the service IP on your LAN:

```bash
yeet info <svc>
yeet ip <svc>
```

Dockerfile (built locally for the host’s arch, then pushed):

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./Dockerfile
```

Binary:

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./bin/<svc>
```

Docker image (pulled on the host):

```bash
yeet run <svc> nginx:latest
```

Local image (push it, then run it):

```bash
yeet docker push <svc> <local-image>:<tag> --run
```

## 5) Observe and iterate

```bash
yeet logs -f <svc>
yeet restart <svc>
```

If you change the binary or compose file, re-run the same `yeet run` command to
roll a new generation. For compose images, add `--pull` (or use
`yeet docker update`) when you want to refresh images.
