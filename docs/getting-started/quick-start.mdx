description: Fastest path to a working yeet + catch install.
---

This is the fastest path to a working install. It assumes you have a Linux host
with Tailscale connected and systemd available.

## 0) Install the toolchain (recommended: mise)

If you already have Go in your `PATH`, skip this step. Otherwise:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Swap `zsh` for your shell (bash/fish/etc.) if needed.

From the repo root, install tools (Go 1.25.5):

```bash
mise install
```

## 1) Install yeet locally

Release install (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yeetrun.com/install.sh | sh
```

Nightly build:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yeetrun.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --nightly
```

From the repo root (dev):

```bash
go build ./cmd/yeet
```

Or install globally:

```bash
go install ./cmd/yeet
```

## 2) Bootstrap catch on a host

Use SSH to install the catch service on a remote host:

```bash
yeet init root@<host>
```

Or use the mise task:

```bash
mise run init-host -- root@<host>
```

If you use a non-root user, yeet will invoke sudo on the remote.

By default, a repo checkout builds and uploads `catch`. To force GitHub releases
instead (or when using a released yeet binary), add `--from-github`. Use
`--nightly` to install the nightly build.

Note: this `<host>` is the **machine host** you SSH into. After install,
`yeet run <svc>@<host>` uses the **catch host** (Tailscale/tsnet hostname).

## 3) Sanity check

```bash
yeet version
yeet status
```

## 4) Deploy something

Docker Compose (most common):

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./compose.yml --net=svc,ts --ts-tags=tag:app
```

Dockerfile (built locally for the host’s arch, then pushed):

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./Dockerfile
```

Binary:

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./bin/<svc>
```

Docker image (pulled on the host):

```bash
yeet run <svc> nginx:latest
```

Local image (push it, then run it):

```bash
yeet docker push <svc> <local-image>:<tag> --run
```

## 5) Observe and iterate

```bash
yeet logs -f <svc>
yeet restart <svc>
```

If you change the binary or compose file, re-run the same `yeet run` command to
roll a new generation. For compose images, add `--pull` (or use
`yeet docker update`) when you want to refresh images.
