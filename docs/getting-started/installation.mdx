description: Install yeet locally and bootstrap catch on a remote host.
---

This is a personal homelab setup. The install flow assumes:

- A Linux host with systemd.
- SSH access to that host.
- You can reach the host from your laptop (LAN or tailnet). You do **not** need
  Tailscale installed locally; yeet embeds tsnet for RPC. See
  [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale).

## Host terminology

- **machine host (SSH)**: the host you connect to for `yeet init root@<host>`.
- **catch host (Tailscale/tsnet)**: the hostname that `yeet` targets for RPC
  (`CATCH_HOST`, `--host`, `@<host>`). After install, this is the tsnet name
  advertised by catch (default `catch` or `--tsnet-host`). See
  [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale).

## Install yeet

Release install (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yeetrun.com/install.sh | sh
```

Nightly build:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yeetrun.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --nightly
```

From the repo root (source build):

```bash
go build ./cmd/yeet
```

Or install globally:

```bash
go install ./cmd/yeet
```

## Install catch on a host

`yeet init` installs `catch` on the remote host. When run from the repo it
builds locally and uploads the binary; when run from a released yeet it
downloads the latest stable release from GitHub before installing.

Use `--nightly` to install the nightly build instead of the latest stable
release.

```bash
yeet init root@<host>
```

Or use the mise task:

```bash
mise run init-host -- root@<host>
```

Notes:

- If you pass a non-root user, yeet will run the install with sudo on the
  remote.
- The catch service runs as root.

## Docker requirements (internal registry)

Yeet’s internal registry expects Docker to use the containerd snapshotter so
pushed images show up locally (no pull needed). Ensure the host has this in
`/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "containerd-snapshotter": true
  }
}
```

Then restart Docker:

```bash
systemctl restart docker
```

## Development toolchain (optional)

If you plan to work on yeet from source, install the toolchain via mise:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Swap `zsh` for your shell (bash/fish/etc.) if needed.

From the repo root, install tools (Go 1.25.5):

```bash
mise install
```

## Manual catch install

If you want to install without yeet:

1) Build `catch` for the target architecture.
2) Copy it to the host.
3) Run `./catch install` on the host.

Example (from the repo root):

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o catch ./cmd/catch
scp catch root@<host>:
ssh root@<host> ./catch install
```

## Catch flags and environment

See the [Catch CLI](/docs/cli/catch-cli) for detailed flags. Common settings:

- `--data-dir` to control where state is stored on the host.
- `--tsnet-host` for RPC connectivity.

## Client defaults

`yeet` stores prefs in `~/.yeet/prefs.json`. You can override at runtime with:

```bash
CATCH_HOST=<host> yeet status
```
