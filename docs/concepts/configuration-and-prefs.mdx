description: Client preferences, project config, and environment variables.

This page documents client and server configuration inputs.

## Client prefs

Yeet stores preferences in:

```
~/.yeet/prefs.json
```

Schema:

```json
{
  "defaultHost": "<host>"
}
```

`defaultHost` is the **catch host** (Tailscale/tsnet hostname used for RPC) that
yeet uses when no host is specified via `@<host>`, `--host`, or `yeet.toml`.
See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for details.

Commands:

```bash
yeet prefs
yeet prefs --save
```

## Project config (`yeet.toml`)

When you run yeet from a project directory it can persist service defaults in a
`yeet.toml` file. This is a convenience layer for the CLI (payloads + flags) and
is not a mirror of catch internals.

Example:

```toml
version = 1
hosts = ["yeet-hetz", "host-b"]

[[services]]
name = "uptime-kuma"
host = "yeet-hetz"
payload = "./uptime-kuma/compose.yml"
args = ["--net=lan"]

[[services]]
name = "api"
host = "host-b"
payload = "./bin/api"
args = ["--flagA", "valueA"]

[[services]]
name = "owesplit"
host = "yeet-pve1"
type = "cron"
payload = "./owesplit/owesplit"
schedule = "0 9 15 * *"
args = ["-live"]
```

Notes:

- `payload` is stored relative to the `yeet.toml` directory when possible.
- `type` is optional; omit it (or set `run`) for `yeet run`, and set `cron` for
  `yeet cron`.
- `args` stores run flags followed by payload args, with the `--` separator
  removed. Yeet re-inserts `--` when needed to re-run the service (for cron this
  is just the binary args after `--`).
- `schedule` is the 5-field cron expression for `type = "cron"`.
- `hosts` is used for host-scoped commands like `yeet status` with no args.

## Environment variables

Client:

- `CATCH_HOST`: default target **catch host** (Tailscale/tsnet hostname).
  See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale).

Server:

- None documented yet.

## Editor

`yeet edit` uses `$EDITOR` if set, otherwise `vim`.
