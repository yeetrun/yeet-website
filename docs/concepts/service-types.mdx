description: Payload detection and installation behavior.
---

Yeet detects payload type and installs the service accordingly.

## Binary

- ELF or Mach-O binary.
- Installed as a systemd service on the host.
- Use `yeet run <svc> ./bin/<svc>`.

## Script

- Shebang file (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env bash`).
- Treated like a binary; installed as a systemd service.

## Docker Compose

- Any YAML with a top-level `services:` key.
- Installed as a docker compose service.
- Use `--pull` on `yeet run` when you want to refresh images; otherwise `run`
  reuses existing images.
- Configure port mappings in the compose file.

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./compose.yml
```

## Docker image

- If the payload looks like an OCI image ref (e.g. `nginx:latest`,
  `ghcr.io/org/app:1.2.3`), yeet generates a compose file and catch pulls the
  image on the host.
- For local images, use `yeet docker push <svc> <image>:<tag> --run`.
- For Dockerfiles, use `yeet run <svc> ./Dockerfile` (builds for the host arch
  and pushes).
- Use `-p`/`--publish` with `yeet run` to expose ports (e.g. `-p 8000:8000`).

## TypeScript

- `.ts` files are run via a Deno container.
- Installed as a docker compose service (via Deno).
- Use `-p`/`--publish` with `yeet run` to expose ports (e.g. `-p 8000:8000`).

## Python

- `.py` files are run via a `uv` container image.
- Installed as a docker compose service (via `uv`).
- Use `-p`/`--publish` with `yeet run` to expose ports (e.g. `-p 8000:8000`).

## Zstd

- Zstd-compressed binaries are detected and unpacked.

## Cron

- `yeet cron` installs a cron-style job as a timer on the host.

## Notes

- File type is detected by extension or content.
- Architecture must match the target host; mismatches fail early.
