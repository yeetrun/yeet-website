title: Data Layout
description: On-host storage layout for catch.
---

Catch stores state on the host under a single data directory (`--data-dir`).
The default is `./data`.

## Top-level

```
<data-dir>/
  db.json
  services/
  mounts/
  registry/
  tsnet/
```

## Per-service layout

```
<data-dir>/services/<svc>/
  bin/   # binaries, compose files, units
  run/   # runtime files
  data/  # persistent app data
  env/   # env files
```

Notes:

- Env files are versioned under `env/` and surfaced via `yeet env show` or
  `yeet env edit`.
- Compose network files and tailscale artifacts live under `bin/` and `run/`.
- `mounts/` is host-global and used by `yeet mount` / `yeet umount`.
