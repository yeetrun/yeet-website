description: Network modes and flags for yeet services.
---

Yeet/catch can place services into different network modes. The mode is
selected with `--net` on `run` or `stage`.

## Modes

- `host` (default): no network namespace, service uses the host network.
- `ts`: Tailscale netns for the service.
- `svc`: per-service virtual IP on an internal subnet.
- `lan`: macvlan on the host LAN.

Modes are comma-separated:

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./compose.yml --net=svc,ts
```

## Tailscale (`ts`)

`--net=ts` adds a Tailscale interface to the service netns, giving the service
its own tailnet IP. Use `yeet tailscale` (alias: `yeet ts`) to run Tailscale
commands for that service.

See the [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) page for setup, flags, and Serve
examples.

## Service network (`svc`)

`svc` assigns a stable private IP from an internal range (`192.168.100.0/24`).

- Use `yeet ip <svc>` to view it.
- This is useful for service-to-service traffic or when combined with
  Tailscale.

## LAN (`lan`)

`lan` uses macvlan to attach the service to the LAN.

- Default parent interface is the system default route.
- Override with `--macvlan-parent`.
- Optional `--macvlan-vlan` and `--macvlan-mac`.

## Mounts

`mount` and `umount` manage network mounts for a service.

```bash
yeet mount <svc> host:/export /mnt/data --type=nfs --opts=defaults
yeet umount <svc> /mnt/data
```

Mount flags:

- `--type` (default `nfs`)
- `--opts` (default `defaults`)
- `--deps` (list of systemd dependencies)
