## Cannot connect to host

- Verify Tailscale is up on both client and host.
- Check the target with `yeet list-hosts`.
- Override host: `CATCH_HOST=<host> yeet status`.
- See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for tailnet setup details.

## Architecture mismatch

- `yeet run` will fail if the binary arch does not match the host.
- Build with `GOOS=linux GOARCH=<arch>`.

## Docker errors

- Docker compose services require docker on the host.
- `catch install` can prompt to install docker if missing.

## `edit` fails without TTY

- `yeet edit` needs a TTY to launch `$EDITOR`.
- Run from a real shell, not a non-interactive session.

## `stage clear` not implemented

- Use `stage show` to inspect, then `stage commit` to apply.

## `copy` destination errors

- One side must be a remote `svc:` or `svc:path`.
- Remote paths are relative to the service data dir (`data/`).
- `yeet copy` defaults to rsync-like `-avz` behavior (archive/recursive,
  verbose, compress).
- Use a trailing slash on the source to copy directory contents (rsync-style).
- Absolute paths are rejected.

## Status output

- Use `--format=json` or `--format=json-pretty` if the table is not useful.

## Service type mismatch

- A service's type is fixed after first install.
- If you installed as docker compose, you cannot later install a binary with
  the same name.
