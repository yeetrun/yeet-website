## How this homelab runs

- Catch runs on each host, and yeet runs from the workstation.
- Services are deployed over Tailscale RPC with explicit network modes (see
  [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale)).
- Host targeting and defaults are driven by `CATCH_HOST` and `yeet.toml`.

## Conventions

- `<svc>` means a service name.
- `<host>` means a host name or `user@host`.
- `<file>` means a local file path.
- Code blocks are intended to be copy-pasteable.
