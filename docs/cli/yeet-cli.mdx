title: yeet CLI
description: Client-side command reference for yeet.
---

This is the client-side command reference. Most commands are forwarded to
catch.

## Host terminology

Yeet uses "host" in two different ways:

- **catch host (Tailscale/tsnet)**: the hostname that `yeet` targets for RPC.
  This is what `CATCH_HOST`, `--host`, and `@<host>` refer to.
- **machine host (SSH)**: the SSH target you use with `yeet init` (for
  installing catch). Example: `yeet init root@<host>`.

After `yeet init`, catch will advertise a tsnet hostname (default `catch` or
`--tsnet-host`). That tsnet name is the **catch host** you use for `yeet run`,
`yeet status`, etc.

See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for how RPC and tailnet addressing
work.

## Global flags

- `--host=<host>`: target host (overrides prefs).
- `--service=<svc>`: force the service name.
- `--tty`: force TTY mode for remote commands.
- `--no-tty`: disable TTY mode for remote commands.
- `--progress=<mode>`: progress output mode (`auto`, `tty`, `plain`, `quiet`).

Host scoping shortcuts:

- `yeet <command>@<host>` for host-only commands (e.g. `events@host`).
- `yeet <command> <svc>@<host>` to target a service on a specific host.

## Commands

Note: Binary payloads uploaded by `run`, `stage`, and `cron` are
zstd-compressed; catch auto-decompresses on receipt.

### `yeet init [REMOTE]`

Install or update catch on a remote host via SSH.

```bash
yeet init root@<host>
```

If omitted, `init` uses the current `CATCH_HOST` value.

Note: the `root@<host>` here is the **machine host** you can reach over SSH. It
is not the catch/tsnet host you target for `yeet run` or `yeet status`.

Run `init` from the yeet source repo (it builds `./cmd/catch`). If you are in a
different repo, clone `github.com/shayne/yeet` and run it from there.

If you omit the SSH user, `init` will try to use the install user reported by
catch (recorded during the last install). If unavailable, SSH defaults apply.
If catch reports an install host, `init` will prefer that host for SSH.

In interactive terminals, `init` will prompt to accept the SSH host key if
needed. For non-interactive runs, pre-populate `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

When stdout is a terminal, `init` uses the full TTY progress UI (spinners, live
updates). Pipe output for plain text. Use `--progress=plain` (or
`--progress=quiet`) for POSIX-friendly scripted output.

### `yeet ssh [<svc>] [-- <remote-cmd...>]`

Open an SSH session to the **catch host** over the tailnet/tsnet address. If
you pass a service name, the session starts in that service's data directory
(`<data-dir>/services/<svc>/data`).

```bash
yeet ssh
yeet ssh <svc>
yeet ssh -- uname -a
yeet ssh <svc> -- ls -la
```

Notes:

- `yeet ssh` targets the **catch host**, not the machine host you used for
  `yeet init`.
- `yeet ssh <svc>` resolves the host from `<svc>@<host>`, `--host`,
  `CATCH_HOST`, or `yeet.toml` service entries, then drops into the service data
  dir.
- Because it connects over Tailscale/tsnet, you can firewall port 22 on
  public/LAN interfaces and still reach the host via your tailnet.
- If catch reports an install user, that user is used for SSH; otherwise your
  SSH defaults apply.
- SSH options can be passed before the service name (e.g.,
  `yeet ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <svc>`).
- Use `--` to pass a remote command. If `<svc>` is provided, the command runs
  from the service directory.

### `yeet run <svc> <file-or-image> [-- <args...>]`

Install or update a service based on the payload:

- Binary or script -> systemd service
- Docker Compose file -> docker compose service
- TypeScript file -> docker compose service using a container runtime
- Python file -> docker compose service using a container runtime
- Docker image ref (`nginx:latest`, `ghcr.io/org/app:latest`) -> pulled on the
  catch host and installed
- `Dockerfile` -> built locally for the remote platform, pushed to the
  internal registry, then installed

Examples:

```bash
yeet run <svc>@<host> ./compose.yml
yeet run <svc> ./compose.yml --net=lan
yeet run --pull <svc> ./compose.yml
yeet run <svc> ./Dockerfile
yeet run <svc> ./bin/<svc> -- --app-flag value
yeet run <svc> ghcr.io/org/app:latest
yeet run -p 8000:8000 <svc> ./server.py
```

`-p`/`--publish` publishes host ports for python/TypeScript/Dockerfile payloads
and registry image refs (e.g. `-p 8000:8000`). For docker compose payloads,
define ports in the compose file.

When stdout is a terminal, `run` uses the full TTY progress UI (spinners, live
updates). Pipe output for plain text. Use `--progress=plain` (or
`--progress=quiet`) for POSIX-friendly scripted output.

If a `yeet.toml` exists (or after your first `run`), you can omit the payload:

```bash
yeet run <svc>
```

Yeet will expand the stored payload + args for that service.

If you want to run a local image instead of pulling from a registry, use
`yeet docker push --run`:

```bash
yeet docker push <svc> <local-image>:<tag> --run
```

Run flags:

- `--pull`: for docker compose/image payloads, pull latest images on deploy.
  Without this, `run` reuses existing images.
- `--net=<list>`: network modes (`ts`, `svc`, `lan`). Comma-separated.
- `--ts-ver=<ver>`: tailscale version for service netns.
- `--ts-exit=<node>`: tailscale exit node.
- `--ts-tags=<tag>`: tailscale tags (repeatable or comma-separated).
- `--ts-auth-key=<key>`: tailscale auth key for service netns.
- `--macvlan-parent=<iface>`: parent interface for `lan`.
- `--macvlan-vlan=<vlan>`: VLAN id for `lan`.
- `--macvlan-mac=<mac>`: MAC address for `lan`.
- `--restart=<bool>`: currently unused.

See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for setup, netns behavior, and Serve
examples.

For compose services, `yeet docker update <svc>` also pulls and recreates
containers.

### `yeet stage <svc> [args...]`

Stage a change without installing it yet.

Examples:

```bash
yeet stage <svc> ./bin/<svc>
yeet stage <svc> --net=ts --ts-tags=tag:app
yeet stage <svc> show
yeet stage <svc> commit
```

Notes:

- `stage show` prints the staged config.
- `stage clear` is not implemented.
- `stage commit` applies the staged version.

Stage flags match `run` flags (see above).

### `yeet copy|cp [-avz] <src> <dst>`

Copy files between local paths and a service data dir (rsync-like).
Exactly one side must be remote using `svc:` or `svc:path` (paths are relative
to the service `data/` directory). By default, `yeet copy` behaves like
`rsync -avz` (archive + verbose + compress).

Examples:

```bash
# Local -> remote (data dir root)
yeet copy ./app.env svc:

# Local -> remote (explicit destination file)
yeet copy ./config.yml svc:config/config.yml

# Local dir contents -> remote dir (rsync-style)
yeet copy ./configs/ svc:config/

# Remote -> local
yeet copy svc:config ./config
```

Notes:

- `-a` is archive mode (includes recursion and metadata preservation).
- `-z` compresses the transfer stream.
- Output mirrors rsync’s file list and summary format.
- File ownership (uid/gid) is not preserved.
- A trailing slash on the source copies directory contents (rsync-style).
- A trailing slash on the destination forces directory semantics.
- Transfers are staged and moved into place only after completion.

### `yeet cron <svc> <file> "<expr>" [-- <args...>]`

Install a cron job from a file. The cron expression must have 5 fields.

```bash
yeet cron <svc> ./job.sh "0 9 * * *" -- --job-arg foo
```

If a `yeet.toml` exists (or after your first `cron`), you can omit the payload
and cron expression:

```bash
yeet cron <svc>
```

When stdout is a terminal, `cron` uses the full TTY progress UI (spinners, live
updates). Use `--progress=plain` (or `--progress=quiet`) for POSIX-friendly
scripted output.

### `yeet logs <svc> [-f] [-n <lines>]`

Tail service logs.

- `-f`/`--follow`: follow logs.
- `-n`/`--lines`: number of lines (default `-1`).

### `yeet status [<svc>] [--format=table|json|json-pretty]`

Show service status.

```bash
yeet status
yeet status <svc> --format=json
```

Notes:

- With no `<svc>`, yeet uses `yeet.toml` host list (if present) and queries
  each host.
- Use `<svc>@<host>` to disambiguate services that exist on multiple hosts.
- Table output always includes the `HOST` column, even for single-host queries.
- Cron services (installed via `yeet cron`) show `TYPE` as `cron`.
- Services show `TYPE` as `binary`, `typescript`, or `python` when detected;
  otherwise `service` or `docker` based on the underlying service type.
- For docker compose services in the no-`<svc>` view, containers are summarized
  into a single `CONTAINERS` column and the status shows running/stopped/partial
  counts.

### `yeet info <svc> [--format=plain|json|json-pretty]`

Show detailed service information collected from both the local `yeet.toml` and
 the remote catch host.

```bash
yeet info <svc>
yeet info <svc>@<host>
yeet info <svc> --format=json
```

Plain output is grouped by section (host, service, client config, server
config, network, runtime, images). Use `--format=json` or
`--format=json-pretty` for machine-readable output.

### `yeet start|stop|restart <svc>`

Manage service lifecycle.

### `yeet enable|disable <svc>`

Enable or disable autostart for a service (systemd-backed services only).

### `yeet remove <svc>`

Remove a service. `yeet` attempts to stop the service and clean up files, but
will still remove the service from the database even if cleanup fails. Any
stop/cleanup failures are printed as warnings.

### `yeet rollback <svc>`

Roll back to the previous generation if available.

### `yeet env show <svc> [--staged]`

Print the current env file for a service. Use `--staged` to inspect the staged
env file.

### `yeet env edit <svc>`

Edit the env file for a service.

### `yeet env copy|cp <svc> <file>`

Upload a local env file.

### `yeet env set <svc> KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE...]`

Set one or more env keys (creates the env file if missing). Use `KEY=` (or
`KEY=""`) to unset a key.

### `yeet edit <svc> [--config] [--ts] [--restart]`

Open the current config for editing in `$EDITOR` (defaults to vim).

- `--config` edits the service JSON (limited; not implemented for
  docker/systemd content).
- `--ts` is reserved.
- `--restart` is currently unused.

### `yeet ip <svc>`

Show the service IP (only meaningful when `--net=svc` was used).

### `yeet mount <source> [name] [flags]`

Mount a network filesystem on the host (global, not per-service). If no args
are given, it lists mounts.

```bash
yeet mount host:/export data-share --type=nfs --opts=defaults
yeet mount             # list mounts
```

### `yeet umount <name>`

Unmount a mount by name.

```bash
yeet umount data-share
```

### `yeet tailscale --setup [--client-secret=...]` (alias: `ts`)

Interactive setup for the catch host's Tailscale OAuth client secret. The CLI
walks you through creating a tag and a trust credential, then stores the
`tskey-client-...` secret on the target host. Use `--client-secret` to skip
the prompt.

See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for the full setup flow and related
flags.

### `yeet tailscale <svc> -- <tailscale args...>` (alias: `ts`)

Run tailscale commands inside the service netns.

```bash
yeet tailscale <svc> -- serve --bg 8080
yeet tailscale <svc> -- debug daemon-logs
```

See [Tailscale](/docs/concepts/tailscale) for Serve/TLS details.

### `yeet events [<svc>] [--all]`

Subscribe to events. Use `--all` for global events.

`yeet events@<host>` is shorthand for subscribing to all events on that host.

### `yeet docker pull|update <svc>`

Docker compose maintenance for services that were installed from compose files.

- `pull` prefetches images without restarting.
- `update` pulls images and recreates containers (restart).

### `yeet docker push <svc> <image> [--run] [--all-local]`

Push a local image into the internal registry.

- `--run`: tag image as `run`.
- `--all-local`: push all local images for the service matching remote OS/arch.

### `yeet list-hosts [--tags=<tags>]`

List tailnet hosts matching tags (default `tag:catch`).

### `yeet prefs [--save]`

Show or save client preferences.

### `yeet version [--json]`

Show the catch server version for the current host.

### `yeet skirt`

Hidden easter egg.
