description: Command model, host targeting, and argument routing.
---

Yeet is the client. Catch runs on remote hosts. Most yeet commands are forwarded
to catch over RPC on your tailnet.

## Command model

Common patterns:

```bash
yeet <command> <svc> [flags] [-- <args...>]
```

## Help

Use `--help` for standard help and `--help-llm` for structured help:

```bash
yeet --help
yeet run --help
yeet run --help-llm
```

## Service selection

- Most commands target a service. If you pass a service name, yeet routes the
  command to that service.
- `--service=<svc>` overrides the service for any command.
- If no service is provided, commands run against the system service (`sys`).
- Some commands are host-level and ignore service selection (e.g., `mount`,
  `umount`, `list-hosts`, `prefs`).

Service name placement:

- The service name should come after known flags/args.
- Unknown flags before the service name can confuse detection. Use `--` to stop
  flag parsing.

Examples:

```bash
yeet status                  # system-wide view
yeet status <svc>             # single service
yeet info <svc>               # detailed service info
yeet status <svc>@<host>       # specific host
yeet --service=<svc> logs -f  # service override
yeet run <svc> ./bin/<svc> -- --app-flag value
```

## Global flags

- `--host=<host>`: override the target **catch host** (also set by `CATCH_HOST`).
- `--service=<svc>`: force a service name for the command.

`yeet prefs` shows the resolved default host. Use `yeet prefs --save` to persist.

Host scoping shortcuts (catch host):

- `yeet <command>@<host>` for host-only commands (e.g., `events@host`).
- `yeet <command> <svc>@<host>` to target a service on a specific host.

If a `yeet.toml` exists with a host list, `yeet status` (no args) queries each
host.

## Passing args to services

For commands that accept arbitrary arguments (run, stage, cron), use `--` to
separate service args from yeet flags and avoid mis-detection:

```bash
yeet run <svc> ./bin/<svc> -- --flag value
yeet cron <svc> ./job "0 9 * * *" -- --job-arg foo
```

## TTY requirements

`yeet edit` and interactive commands require a TTY. Run them from an
interactive shell.
