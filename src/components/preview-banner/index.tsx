 * PreviewBanner displays a warning banner when viewing the

 * This component checks the GIT_COMMIT_REF environment variable
 * at build time. When the site is built from the "tip" branch
 * (nightly/development version), it shows a yellow warning banner
 * at the top of every page informing users they're viewing the
 * development version and provides a link to the stable site.
 *
 * The banner is conditionally rendered - it returns null when
 * not on the tip branch, ensuring zero impact on the stable
 * production site.
